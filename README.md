# A2A Architecture Diagrams

## High-Level A2A Protocol Flow

![A2A Protocol Flow](./a2a-protocol-diagram.png)
*Figure 1: The A2A protocol enables a client/orchestrator agent to communicate with one or more remote agents, which may themselves coordinate with other agents. This enables distributed, multi-agent workflows.*

## Agent Internal Structure

*Figure 2: Each agent exposes an Agent Card and is composed of a protocol handler, task/capability layer, and may include LLMs, frameworks, and databases as needed.*
